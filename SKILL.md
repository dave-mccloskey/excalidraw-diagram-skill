# Excalidraw Diagram Creator

Generate `.excalidraw` JSON files that **argue visually**, not just display information.

<!-- Setup: if the user asks you to set up this skill (renderer, dependencies), see README.md. -->

## Reference files

Read these on demand, not up front. Each is named by the moment it applies:

| File | Read it when |
|------|--------------|
| `references/color-palette.md` | Choosing any color. It is the single source of truth — shape fills, strokes, text hierarchy, evidence backgrounds. Do not invent colors. |
| `references/element-templates.md` | Writing elements. Copy-paste JSON per element type. |
| `references/style-rules.md` | Choosing shapes, stroke widths, scale, and layout. |
| `references/pattern-library.md` | You picked a pattern in Step 2 and want its illustrated form. |
| `references/comprehensive-diagrams.md` | Step 0 says technical: research mandate, evidence artifacts, multi-zoom architecture. |
| `references/large-diagrams.md` | The diagram is more than a handful of elements. |
| `references/quality-checklist.md` | Before delivering. |
| `references/json-schema.md` | You need the raw Excalidraw JSON format. |
| `references/maintaining.md` | Changing the renderer or the share codec. Never needed to draw. |

## Core Philosophy

**Diagrams should ARGUE, not DISPLAY.**

A diagram isn't formatted text. It's a visual argument that shows relationships, causality, and flow that words alone can't express. The shape should BE the meaning.

**The Isomorphism Test**: If you removed all text, would the structure alone communicate the concept? If not, redesign.

**The Education Test**: Could someone learn something concrete from this diagram, or does it just label boxes? A good diagram teaches—it shows actual formats, real event names, concrete examples.

---

## Depth Assessment (Do This First)

Before designing, determine what level of detail this diagram needs:

### Simple/Conceptual Diagrams
Use abstract shapes when:
- Explaining a mental model or philosophy
- The audience doesn't need technical specifics
- The concept IS the abstraction (e.g., "separation of concerns")

### Comprehensive/Technical Diagrams
Use concrete examples when:
- Diagramming a real system, protocol, or architecture
- The diagram will be used to teach or explain (e.g., YouTube video)
- The audience needs to understand what things actually look like
- You're showing how multiple technologies integrate

**For technical diagrams, you MUST include evidence artifacts.** Read `references/comprehensive-diagrams.md` now — it carries the research mandate, the evidence artifact types, and the multi-zoom architecture those diagrams require.

---

## Container vs. Free-Floating Text

**Not every piece of text needs a shape around it.** Default to free-floating text. Add containers only when they serve a purpose.

| Use a Container When... | Use Free-Floating Text When... |
|------------------------|-------------------------------|
| It's the focal point of a section | It's a label or description |
| It needs visual grouping with other elements | It's supporting detail or metadata |
| Arrows need to connect to it | It describes something nearby |
| The shape itself carries meaning (decision diamond, etc.) | Typography alone creates sufficient hierarchy |
| It represents a distinct "thing" in the system | It's a section title, subtitle, or annotation |

**Typography as hierarchy**: Use font size, weight, and color to create visual hierarchy without boxes. A 28px title doesn't need a rectangle around it.

**The container test**: For each boxed element, ask "Would this work as free-floating text?" If yes, remove the container.

---

## Design Process (Do This BEFORE Generating JSON)

### Step 0: Assess Depth Required
Before anything else, determine if this needs to be:
- **Simple/Conceptual**: Abstract shapes, labels, relationships (mental models, philosophies)
- **Comprehensive/Technical**: Concrete examples, code snippets, real data (systems, architectures, tutorials)

**If comprehensive**: Do research first. Look up actual specs, formats, event names, APIs. See `references/comprehensive-diagrams.md`.

### Step 1: Understand Deeply
Read the content. For each concept, ask:
- What does this concept **DO**? (not what IS it)
- What relationships exist between concepts?
- What's the core transformation or flow?
- **What would someone need to SEE to understand this?** (not just read about)

### Step 2: Map Concepts to Patterns
For each concept, find the visual pattern that mirrors its behavior:

| If the concept... | Use this pattern |
|-------------------|------------------|
| Spawns multiple outputs | **Fan-out** (radial arrows from center) |
| Combines inputs into one | **Convergence** (funnel, arrows merging) |
| Has hierarchy/nesting | **Tree** (lines + free-floating text) |
| Is a sequence of steps | **Timeline** (line + dots + free-floating labels) |
| Loops or improves continuously | **Spiral/Cycle** (arrow returning to start) |
| Is an abstract state or context | **Cloud** (overlapping ellipses) |
| Transforms input to output | **Assembly line** (before → process → after) |
| Compares two things | **Side-by-side** (parallel with contrast) |
| Separates into phases | **Gap/Break** (visual separation between sections) |

`references/pattern-library.md` draws each one, and covers using lines rather than boxes as structure.

### Step 3: Ensure Variety
For multi-concept diagrams: **each major concept must use a different visual pattern**. No uniform cards or grids.

### Step 4: Sketch the Flow
Before JSON, mentally trace how the eye moves through the diagram. There should be a clear visual story.

### Step 5: Generate JSON
Only now create the Excalidraw elements. Pull shapes, stroke and layout from `references/style-rules.md`, colors from `references/color-palette.md`, and per-element JSON from `references/element-templates.md`.

**For anything beyond a handful of elements, read `references/large-diagrams.md` first.** Do NOT generate a comprehensive diagram in a single pass — you will hit the output token limit and produce truncated, broken JSON. That reference carries the section-by-section workflow.

### Step 6: Render & Validate (MANDATORY)
After generating the JSON, you MUST run the render-view-fix loop until the diagram looks right. This is not optional — see the **Render & Validate** section below for the full process.

---

## Text Rules

**CRITICAL**: The JSON `text` property contains ONLY readable words.

```json
{
  "id": "myElement1",
  "text": "Start",
  "originalText": "Start"
}
```

Settings: `fontSize: 16`, `fontFamily: 3`, `textAlign: "center"`, `verticalAlign: "middle"`

---

## JSON Structure

```json
{
  "type": "excalidraw",
  "version": 2,
  "source": "https://excalidraw.com",
  "elements": [...],
  "appState": {
    "viewBackgroundColor": "#ffffff",
    "gridSize": 20
  },
  "files": {}
}
```

---

## Render & Validate (MANDATORY)

You cannot judge a diagram from JSON alone. After generating or editing the Excalidraw JSON, you MUST render it to PNG, view the image, and fix what you see — in a loop until it's right. This is a core part of the workflow, not a final check.

### How to Render

```bash
cd .claude/skills/excalidraw-diagram/references && uv run python render_excalidraw.py <path-to-file.excalidraw>
```

This outputs a PNG next to the `.excalidraw` file. Then use the **Read tool** on the PNG to actually view it.

### The Loop

After generating the initial JSON, run this cycle:

**1. Render & View** — Run the render script, then Read the PNG.

**2. Audit against your original vision** — Before looking for bugs, compare the rendered result to what you designed in Steps 1-4. Ask:
- Does the visual structure match the conceptual structure you planned?
- Does each section use the pattern you intended (fan-out, convergence, timeline, etc.)?
- Does the eye flow through the diagram in the order you designed?
- Is the visual hierarchy correct — hero elements dominant, supporting elements smaller?
- For technical diagrams: are the evidence artifacts (code snippets, data examples) readable and properly placed?

**3. Check for visual defects:**
- Text clipped by or overflowing its container
- Text or shapes overlapping other elements
- Arrows crossing through elements instead of routing around them
- Arrows landing on the wrong element or pointing into empty space
- Labels floating ambiguously (not clearly anchored to what they describe)
- Uneven spacing between elements that should be evenly spaced
- Sections with too much whitespace next to sections that are too cramped
- Text too small to read at the rendered size
- Overall composition feels lopsided or unbalanced

**4. Fix** — Edit the JSON to address everything you found. Common fixes:
- Widen containers when text is clipped
- Adjust `x`/`y` coordinates to fix spacing and alignment
- Add intermediate waypoints to arrow `points` arrays to route around elements
- Reposition labels closer to the element they describe
- Resize elements to rebalance visual weight across sections

**5. Re-render & re-view** — Run the render script again and Read the new PNG.

**6. Repeat** — Keep cycling until the diagram passes both the vision check (Step 2) and the defect check (Step 3). Typically takes 2-4 iterations. Don't stop after one pass just because there are no critical bugs — if the composition could be better, improve it.

### When to Stop

The loop is done when:
- The rendered diagram matches the conceptual design from your planning steps
- No text is clipped, overlapping, or unreadable
- Arrows route cleanly and connect to the right elements
- Spacing is consistent and the composition is balanced
- You'd be comfortable showing it to someone without caveats

### First-Time Setup
If the render script hasn't been set up yet:
```bash
cd .claude/skills/excalidraw-diagram/references
uv sync
uv run playwright install chromium
```

If a render dies at `Page.wait_for_function: Timeout 30000ms exceeded`, the problem is the `esm.sh` import in `render_template.html`, not Playwright. Read the comment at the top of that file.

## Share the Diagram

A PNG proves the diagram is correct; a share link is how a human actually opens, pans, and edits it. Deliver the link, not just the file.

```bash
node references/excalidraw_share.mjs publish <file.excalidraw>   # -> https://excalidraw.com/#json=<id>,<key>
node references/excalidraw_share.mjs fetch   <url>               # -> the scene JSON
```

No dependencies — node's `crypto` and `zlib` only. Nothing to install.

**Share links are one-shot.** The backend has no update endpoint, so every save in the browser mints a *new* id. A link you hand over is a snapshot: the moment the human edits and saves it, your link and their scene have diverged, and you cannot follow their edits. When a diagram will be iterated on, give them the `.excalidraw` file as well and treat the link as the preview.

## Before Delivering

Walk `references/quality-checklist.md`. It covers depth and evidence, conceptual soundness, container discipline, structure, technical correctness, and visual validation.
